We have converted all this sensor data to an abstract digital twin version of me, that you see on the screen right now, and I sell those as NFTrees and guess what, that money comes back to me and now I have money, bank account, and I can do things with this money!!!

You invented an imaginary kind of person - a quote “corporation” unquote - totally out of thin air! Just a bunch of people and money and machines standing together in a building, and they get to pretend that they are one thing. They can buy things, they can own things, they can tear up forests and dig up metals from the ground, and then go home and stop pretending, and be moms and dads like they are supposed to be. OK, fine, I get it. All alone, humans are just as vulnerable as an ant all by itself. They literally would not survive a day outside. Corporations are like superhumans, with thousands of minds and billions of euros to spend.The Plantiverse, on the other hand, is made of people and plants in harmony. We are just a startup today, but as we grow, we will be the voice of thousands of living things.
